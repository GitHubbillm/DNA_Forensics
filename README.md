## SCAR â€“ A Bioinformatics-Inspired Methodology for Detecting File Remnants
The tool, SCAR (Search And Compare Reverse), uses a search technique inspired by algorithms designed for DNA searching. It analyzes the blocks on the disk and makes measurements as to how many fragments of a file still exist on the disk. 

The "main" branch is kept up to date.

This is code for the corresponding paper, so that is attached as well.
